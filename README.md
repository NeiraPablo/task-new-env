## Task: Working with python environments

1. Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/NeiraPablo/task-new-env.git`

2. Create a new environment from the yml file

`conda env create --file env-taskenv.yml`

3. Move to the new environment created

`conda activate taskenv`	

4. Run the code 

`python script_sample.py`

**NOTE:** you don't need to download the different libraries used as they already install 
as you create the environment from the yml file.
